For this first task is to attempt to geocode (find latitude and longitude for each entry) as much of the data as possible using the given variables.
The ultimate goal of this assignment is to attempt to reconstruct the boundaries of the 22 Manhattan New York City police precincts (numbered between 1 and 34). The parking violation data set contains the column, Violation.Precinct, that lists the police precinct in which the violation ostensibly took place. The goal is to take this data along with the geocoded locations from Task 1 and generate a set of spatial polygons that represents the boundaries of the precincts.
